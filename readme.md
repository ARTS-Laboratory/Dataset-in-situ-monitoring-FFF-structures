# Real-time structural validation for fused filament fabrication components

This repo is the in situ monitroing and decision making for the component manufacturing by fused filament favrication.

## [Dataset1]
Dataset related to two parts:
1. The defect images for machine learning.
2. The tesile test result to build the defect imapct decision boundary.
