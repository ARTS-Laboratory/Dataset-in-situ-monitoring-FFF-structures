# Real-time structural validation for fused filament fabrication components

## Dataset 1
The defect in this project has five varialbes: defect length, defect position, defect line, defect occuring layer, and total layers with defect. Therefore, there is a specific naming rule for both the defect images and tensile test results. From the file name, you can know some information about the defect in this sample. For example, the image named 'line1length1position1layer2' means there is a 1 mm defect occuring on layer 2 at line a position 1. The tensile force file with 'LINE3L01L234IN16center' means this sample on layer 2, 3, and 4, each layer has a 1 mm defect at line 1 and position 16. For more information, please refer to the paper will publish soon.
