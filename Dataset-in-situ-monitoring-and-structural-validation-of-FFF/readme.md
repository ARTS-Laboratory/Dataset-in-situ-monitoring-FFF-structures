# Real-time structural validation for fused filament fabrication components

This repo is the in situ monitroing and decision making for the component manufacturing by fused filament favrication.

## [Dataset-in-situ-monitoring-and-structural-validation-of-FFF]
Dataset related to two parts:
1. The defect images for machine learning.
2. The tesile test result to build the defect imapct decision boundary.

## [Real-time-component-validation-for-the-FFF-process]
This folder related to the code used in this project:
1. The machine learning (CNN) code for predicting the defect.
2. The support vector machine for buliding the defect imapct decision boundary.
