# Dataset in situ structural validation of additively manufactured polymer components

This repo is the in situ monitroing and decision-making for the component manufacturing by fused filament fabrication.

## [Dataset1]
Dataset contains two parts:
1. The defect images for machine learning.
2. The tensile test results for building the defect impact decision boundary.
